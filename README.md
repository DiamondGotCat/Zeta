# Zeta - LLM created by everyone
Zeta is divided into three repositories.

- Anyone can create LLMs using the Zeta-Tool.
- Zeta-Dataset is the publication location of datasets for the Zeta-Tool.
- Azuki-Format is the format of datasets for the Zeta-Tool.

## Next Relase: Zeta 2
**üõ†Ô∏è Zeta 2 is training...**

On a single Mac Mini with 32GB of RAM, Zeta 2 is being carefully trained from scratch.

It's not running on a massive cluster ‚Äî just a single machine, 24/7, with dedication.

Estimated training time: 400+ hours.

This is what it means to build a Large Language Model with love ‚Äî not scale.

## License
It's MIT licensed.
I decided on this license because it makes it easy and free for anyone to use.

- [Zeta-Dataset](https://github.com/DiamondGotCat/Zeta-Dataset/releases): Datasets for Zeta-Tool
- [Azuki-Format(AzukiF)](https://github.com/DiamondGotCat/Azuki-Format): Dataset Format for Zeta-Tool

(NOTE: Hinode-AI, and Azuki-AI is Marged to Zeta Project)

## What is NLoRAT?

**NLoRAT (Non-LoRA Tuning)** is a simple method of fine-tuning an existing LLM *without* using LoRA or adapters.  
You just train the model as-is, using your own dataset (e.g. in Azuki Format).  
No special tools or architecture changes are required.

If you can run the original LLM, you can also run the LLM with NLoRAT.
