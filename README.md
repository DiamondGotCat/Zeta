# Zeta - LLM created by everyone
Zeta is divided into three repositories.
- Anyone can create LLMs using the Zeta-Tool.
- Zeta-Dataset is the publication location of datasets for the Zeta-Tool.
- Azuki-Format is the format of datasets for the Zeta-Tool.

## License
It's MIT licensed.
I decided on this license because it makes it easy and free for anyone to use.
